They’re avid cavy enthusiasts, so they opened their doors (and hearts!) to floofs from around the UK who are on the search for a new hooman family. And some piggies are lucky enough to stay at the guinea pig rescue permanently. <\/p><p>Special needs guinea pigs, whether they have a disability or are senior piggizens with additional needs, live comfortably and are well cared for, without having to go through the strain of moving again. The other half, however, stop by to get assessed, receive any treatment (and lots of TLC), and are rehabilitated before they move on to other pastures green.<\/p><p>Tara is a pigspert with plenty of experience in cavy care. She and Ian have a long-standing relationship with Kavee’s CEO and co-founder, Clementine Schouteden, who used to live on the Isle of Wight. Tara and Clementine started Gigglepigs and Kavee around the same time and have shared their love for and knowledge of guinea pigs ever since.<\/p><p>Over the years, Tara has shared her never-ending guinea pig expertise, while Clem supported the rescue work with regular donations and carloads of Kavee goodies. Now, they’re combining their efforts and joining forces to create the Kavee Rescue, a safe haven for guinea pigs in need that supports small animal welfare and raises awareness for the amazing work Tara and Ian do.<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":""}},"faq":{"type":"faq","blocks":{"question-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How can I contact the rescue?","answer":"<p><strong>You can contact us via email at therescue@kaveecage.net<\/strong><\/p>"}},"question-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How old is the Rescue?","answer":"<p><strong>The Rescue was set up in 2020 by the wonderful husband-and-wife duo Tara and Ian as Giggle Pigs Rescue.

And the work never stops!<br\/>On top of feeding, cleaning, and TLC, the Kavee Guinea Pig Rescue also speaks with piggy parents who have made the heartbreaking decision to surrender their pets, to see how we can support them. And, on a much brighter note, we welcome prospective piggy parents to the rescue to meet their cute cavy companions. It’s really important to us to find the perfect fit for piggies and parents, so Tara and Ian take extra care in the match-making process. And then there’s popcorn parties all around!<br\/>For the in-house piggies, the Kavee Guinea Pig Rescue goes through incredible amounts of food, cleaning products, and - maybe most surprisingly - washing machines. About ten loads of piggy washing are done every day.<br\/>And the donations the rescue receives from passionate piggy parents are crucial to the work we do.
